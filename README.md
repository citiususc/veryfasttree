# VeryFastTree

**VeryFastTree** is a highly-tuned implementation of the [FastTree-2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009490) tool that takes advantage of parallelization and vectorization strategies to speed up the inference of phylogenies for huge alignments. It is important to highlight that **VeryFastTree** keeps unchanged the phases, methods and heuristics used by FastTree-2 to estimate the phylogenetic tree. In this way, it produces trees with the same topological accuracy than FastTree-2. In addition, unlike the parallel version of FastTree-2, VeryFastTree is deterministic.

Regarding the performance, for example, **VeryFastTree** (v3.0 - May 2020) is able to construct a tree on a standard server (12-core Intel Xeon E5-2680v3 processor and 128 GiB of memory) using double precision arithmetic from an [ultra-large 330k alignment](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/) in only 4.5 hours, which is 7.8× and 3.5× faster than the sequential and best parallel FastTree-2 times, respectively.

To facilitate the adoption from the research community, VeryFastTree keeps exactly the same command line arguments than FastTree-2. In this way, it is only necessary to replace the call to FastTree-2 by a call to VeryFastTree using the same options to increase the overall performance.

# Getting started #

## Requirements

All the libraries needed to compile **VeryFastTree** are included inside the lib folder. The
other basic requirements are:

* CMake v3.5+
* C++11 compiler
    * GCC 5+ (GCC 4 is [bugged](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56859))
    * Visual studio 2015 (previous versions with support for C++11 may work)
* make (linux only)
* CUDA Toolkit (Cuda only)

## Configuring

CMake will generate the necessary configuration files for the compilation. In Linux/MacOS by
default a native compilation is done for the considered architecture. This
allows to detect automatically the hardware features. If the
program is going to be executed on a different machine, this option must be disabled.

Options can be listed with cmake:

    cmake -LH

    // enable/disable system's processor architecture optimization (linux)
    USE_NATIVE:BOOL=ON

    // enable/disable SSE2 in Windows (Linux default)
    USE_SEE2:BOOL=ON

    // enable/disable SSE4.1
    USE_SEE4:BOOL=OFF

    // enable/disable AVX
    USE_AVX:BOOL=OFF

    // enable/disable AVX2
    USE_AVX2:BOOL=OFF

    // enable/disable AVX512
    USE_AVX512:BOOL=OFF
	
    // enable/disable CUDA
    USE_CUDA:BOOL=OFF
    
	// change CUDA Architecture
    CUDA_ARCH:STRING=80

Example:

    cmake -DUSE_NATIVE=OFF -DUSE_SEE4=ON . // Disable native compilation and use SSE 4.1

## Building

Windows:

    cmake [options] .
    cmake --build

Linux/MacOS:

    cmake [options] .
    make
    make install #Optional


## Running VeryFastTree ##

**To improve the usability and facilitate the adoption of VeryFastTree, it implements the same command interface than FastTree-2. It means that arguments have exactly the same behavior as in FastTree-2.** All these arguments can be consulted with the *-h* option. As a consequence, to take advantage of the performance benefits provided by VeryFastTree is only necessary to replace the call to FastTree-2 by a call to VeryFastTree using the same options.  

VeryFastTree accepts alignments in NEXUS, Fasta, Fastq or Phylip interleaved formats compressed with ZLib and libBZ2.

On the other hand, VeryFastTree has its own extra arguments which have been grouped in the  *Optimizations* section. These arguments are related to the parametrization of the different parallelization and vectorization strategies included in VeryFastTree. Next we list and explain the new arguments available:

- **-threads [n]**
Number of threads (*n*) used in the parallel execution. If this option is not set, the corresponding value will be obtained from the environment variable *OMP\_NUM\_THREADS*. This is the same approach followed by FastTree-2. If *n=1*, VeryFastTree behaves in the same way than FastTree-2 compiled without the *-DOPENMP* flag.

- **-threads-level [level]**
Degree of parallelization: 
	- If level is *0*, VeryFastTree uses the same parallelization strategy as FastTree-2 with some new parallel blocks. 
	- If level is *1*, VeryFastTree uses parallel blocks that require additional memory for computation. 
	- If level is *2*, VeryFastTree accelerates the rounds of ML NNIs using its tree partitioning method. 
	- If level is *3* (default), VeryFastTree performs more computations without preserving sequential order.
	- If level is *4*, VeryFastTree accelerates the rounds of SPR steps using its tree partitioning method (it can only be used with datasets larger than 2^sprlength + 2). 

    Note: Each level includes the previous ones, and computation at level *2* and above is performed in a different tree traverse order, so the result may change but is still correct.

- **-threads-mode [mode]**
Changes the mode of parallelization: 
	- If level is *0*, VeryFastTree uses non-deterministic parts, some inspired by FastTree-2 but improved. 
	- If level is *1* (default), VeryFastTree only uses deterministic parallelization.

    Since version 4.0, deterministic algorithms are at least faster than non-deterministic ones, making deterministic the preferred choice.

- **-threads-ptw [n]**
(Partitioning Tendency Window) It sets the size of the partitioning tendency window used by the tree partitioning algorithm to determine when to stop searching. The window stores the last solutions and checks if a better solution can be found. Increasing the value allows the algorithm to explore the tree deeper and potentially find better solutions. The default value is 20.

- **-threads-verbose**
To show subtrees assigned to the threads and theoretical speedup, only with verbose > 0

- **-double-precision**
To use double precision arithmetic. Therefore, it is equivalent to compile FastTree-2 with *-DUSE\_DOUBLE*.

- **-ext [type]**
It enables the vector extensions:
    - **AUTO**: (default) selects AVX2 when *-double-precision* is used and SEE3 otherwise. If one extension is not available, the previous level is used.
    - **NONE**: Operations are performed with the native programming language operators. In addition, loops are unrolled with the aim of providing hints to the compiler for applying some optimization (including vectorization).
    - **SSE3**: Arithmetic operations are performed using SSE3 vector intrinsics. Each instruction operates on 128 bit registers, which could contain four 32-bit floats or two 64-bit doubles.
    - **AVX**: Arithmetic operations are performed using AVX vector intrinsics. Each instruction operates on 256 bit registers, which could contain eight 32-bit floats or four 64-bits doubles.
    - **AVX2**: Similar to AVX, but some arithmetic operations are performed using  additional AVX2 vector intrinsics not included in the AVX instruction set. Each instruction operates on 256 bit registers, which could contain eight 32-bit floats or four 64-bit doubles).
    - **AVX512**: Arithmetic operations are performed using AVX512 vector intrinsics. Each instruction operates on 512 bit registers, which could contain sixteen 32-bit floats or eight 64-bits doubles.
    - **CUDA**: (Experimental) Arithmetic operations are performed using NVIDIA CUDA.

- **-fastexp [implementation]**
This option is used to select an alternative implementation for the exponential function (e<sup>x</sup>), which has a significant impact on performance:
    - **0**: (default) Use the *exp* function included in the built-in math library with double precision.
    - **1**: Use the *exp* function included in the built-in math library with simple precision (not recommended together with *-double-precision* option).
    - **2**: Use a very efficient and fast implementation to compute an accurate approximation of e<sup>x</sup> using double precision arithmetic.
    - **3**: Use a very efficient and fast implementation to compute an accurate approximation of e<sup>x</sup> using simple precision arithmetic (not recommended together with *-double-precision* option).

- **-disk-computing**
If there is not enough available RAM to perform the computation, disk will be used to store extra data when it was not needed. Using disk to perform the computation will substantially increase the execution time.

- **-disk-computing-path [path]**
Like **-disk-computing** but using a custom path folder to store data.

- **-disk-dynamic-computingg**
By default, disk computing only creates files associated with static data in RAM, which means that there is no significant impact on performance as long as there is available RAM. This option further reduces memory usage by storing dynamic data on disk. However, even if there is enough RAM, it will have a negative impact on performance due to the creation and deletion of files.
